/*

1. how passport is having access to email ,password we are sending through /users/login route
2.how the function that takes passport as parameter and which is returned from config/passport.js file will be triggered when we call passport.authenticate('local')
3.why only the user not found error msg is being displayed ,only when we set the error msg as json: message:'some error msg' ,not something like json:text:'error msg'
